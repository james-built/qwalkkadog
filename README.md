# qwalkkadog
Third week Friday group project

## Introduction
* This was a project we came up with to build on what we had learnt during the week about databases
* We designed it to have multiple kinds of users with data being dependent on the user type (i.e. dog owners & dog walkers)
* People who wanted to walk dogs would be able to connect with those who were too busy to walk their dog
* We had ambitions to have the user be able to set preferences for types of dogs & locations they wanted to be walking in but we reduced the scope to be able to deliver this as a single day project
* A team of 5 of us worked on this project however as we were sharing computers the commit history isn't representative of what each member contributed.


## Try It Out
* Clone down this repo and run `npm install`
* Use `npm start` to run the server which is configured to be on http://localhost:3000
